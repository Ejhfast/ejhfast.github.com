    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
        During my PhD I did research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Programming Languages, 
        and Natural Language Processing. I led work on more than ten published projects, most of which involved 
        significant systems building. My full publication record is available 
        on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PMjGlW4AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> but I've included 
        a few of my favorite research initiatives below.
