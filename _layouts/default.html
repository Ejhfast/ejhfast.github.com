                    I'm currently a co-founder at <a href="http://nash.io">Nash</a>, a non-custodial exchange and asset management platform for cryptocurrencies and other tokens. 
                    I have a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford and have published articles in leading journals and conferences, such as Nature, CHI, EMNLP, and AAAI. 
                    Previously, I co-founded Proxino, a web analytics company funded by Y Combinator.

                    My main professional skillset is on the product side: from communicating and refining a vision to building, shipping, and iterating. 
                    I developed and honed these skills at Nash, Proxino, and across the many user-facing projects I worked on throughout my PhD.
                    I also enjoy working on applied research problems, especially when they enable a product vision, and have experience scaling engineering teams and processes as a company grows.
