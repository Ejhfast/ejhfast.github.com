title: The Aspirational Polymath

These days, fields of study specialize intensely. It’s hard to achieve
mastery in one field, let alone others. I’ve worked with professors at
some of the best universities in the world, and even these successful
academics will quickly acknowledge ignorance with respect to
sub-disciplines of their chosen fields.

Knowledge has also fragmented within a field’s sub-disciplines. While in
grad school, one of my research areas was Programming Languages (PL), and
Stanford recruits brilliant PL faculty. Yet I had a conversation the
other day, wherein one such professor admitted that it’s “hard to know
what he doesn’t know,” about *some other* subset of programming
language research.

Human knowledge has expanded so much, it’s impossible to keep up with
the whole of one’s sub-discipline. To academics, this is hardly a
revelation — things have been this way for some time.

Yet, a polymath is traditionally defined as an expert in many distinct
disciplines. Perhaps like me, you aspire to be one? Well, good luck[^1].
The traditional polymath is dead, and in the romantic sense,
that’s a shame. Pragmatically of course, it’s quite the opposite.
Specialization is a side-effect of the growth of human knowledge, and by
most standards that’s an unequivocal good.

As a result, the modern meaning of polymath has devolved into something
like, “jack of all trades,” a role decidedly less appealing. This sort
of generalist still does important work, and often bridges the chasm
between unrelated disciplines. But it’s not exactly a satisfying
aesthetic. Maybe in modern times no one can embody the old meaning of
polymath, but I can’t help but wonder: are all aspiring polymaths fated
to become generalists? I don’t know.

The best we can do is strive for excellence in *all* that we do. Even if
we do many, many things. So, perhaps the polymath is dead.

But long live the polymath.
