title: State Your Purpose

Now that my PhD admission cycle is over, and the dust has cleared, I'm planning
to write a few posts about the grad school application process. This
first post will be about crafting your statement of purpose (sometimes
known as a “personal statement”). It’s a statement that broadly
describes your reasons for pursuing a PhD at a particular university.

Around four months ago, I was interested in reading a few good examples
of personal statements. Unfortunately, it seems that few people like to
share. The one exception I found online (and later met at MIT’s visit
days) was [Jean Yang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jeanyang/). So to
current grad school applicants: I empathize with your pain, and I’m
crazy enough to share one of my statements[^1]. This is the one I
sent to Stanford, where I’ll be starting a CS PhD next fall.

So how do you write a statement of purpose? There is no fully general reciple. 
However, I do understand what worked for me, and so I can
mention a few things that I kept in mind:

-   **Write Well**: This is both fairly obvious, and obviously hard. Two things
     that annoy me (and more notably, Stephen King) are passive voice and
    unnecessary adverbs. I recommend reading *On Writing* and *The
    Elements of Style*.
-   **Talk About Research**: Write about things that relate to your
    abilities as a researcher. Nearly everything else is extraneous.
-   **Tell a Story**: I don't mean “make things up.” Draw your work
    into a narrative.
    Humans love storytelling not lists of
    facts.
-   **Use Concrete Examples**: Speak about things that you have
    accomplished or attempted. Most people will see your past as a
    strong predictor of your future. Describe the research you’ve done,
    and the ideas you’ve explored.
-   **Tailor the Statement**: For each school, mention reasons that your
    research interests are a good match for particular faculty. Make
    each statement specific to its target program.
-   **Carve Out Responsibility**: If you have done research, speak to
    those elements of the research that you “owned.” Show that you did
    more than implement someone else’s ideas.
-   **Have Vision**: What plans do you have for your future, and for the
    future of your research? If you don’t have any plans, consider
    making some. You are not beholden to your personal statement.
    Faculty are more likely to admit you if they can
    envision you in their program doing real research.
-   **Make Yourself Awesome**: You are the second coming of Alan Turing,
    and your statement should make this clear. Be sure, however, to show
    deference to the professors at the school to which you are applying.
    They are even more awesome than you.
-   **Your Childhood is not Relevant**: This is perhaps cliché, but
    don’t regale the admissions committee with tales from your
    childhood. They don’t want to hear about it. Only say things which
    speak to your research potential.

That should be enough to get you started. If you are applying now, I wish you luck. Hopefully,
this post has given you some new ideas.
