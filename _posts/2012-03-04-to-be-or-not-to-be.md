title: You're Afraid to Be Anything

I write fiction, and occasionally I exchange critiques with other
writers. I’ve noted lately a certain stigma and fear with respect to the
verb *to be*, an over-reaction to passivity. Allow me to illustrate.

Suppose you write, “the air was cold.” This isn’t a brilliant or
interesting sentence, and that’s exactly the point. It draws a necessary
image without any distraction. A reader ingests its depiction much as he
or she breaths oxygen: readily, and without thought[^1].

The average critiquer finds this sort of language disagreeable.
“It’s too boring, too passive,” they will say. “Consider instead
something like, *the frigid air bit into his skin*.”

Well, you did consider that. But sometimes you don’t want the reader to
care about the air. You want them to care about *something else*. You
simply need them to know, to absorb, and to move on.

Sometimes, *the air is just cold*.

[^1]: Of course this is not always desirable.
