title: The Artful Mastering of Goals

I’ve been thinking lately about thinking: how to optimally construct
mental frameworks that encourage long-run success. As part of this
metacognition, I’ve thought about goals, and I’ve come to some
unintuitive conclusions. While goals are generally useful, goal-oriented
thinking (if taken too far) can encourage an undesirable cognitive bias.

A goal is not the same as the motivation which brought it into
existence. It is more precisely defined. This precision makes a
goal useful — it provides an unambiguous measure of progress — but it
also creates a subtle danger. Goals are lossy with respect to their
motivating principles. Look at one goal, and it tells you little about
why it exists, or what aspirations were its fundamental cause.

In setting goals, you lower a complex abstraction — the nature of your
self — into the veins of reality. Goals suggest what you are, but they
are not *you*. And this is the danger. You can become so ruthless at
achieving goals that you abandon the underlying motivations which
brought them into existence. You can master the how, but lose the why.

Suppose you set a goal for various reasons. Over time, it grows in
importance, and you invest in it as a measure of progress. You meet with
some initial success, and become excited. You begin to define yourself
by the goal. Slowly, it usurps its originating abstraction, and deposes
the information-rich motivations of self. Not good. You’ve shaved the
dimensions of your character into neat and precise edges.

So it’s important to have goals, but don’t forget why you have them.
Don’t forget what you are.
