title: The Rise of Coderacy

Today I recalled a book I read
years ago, small and black with a stark white title: <span
class="underline">Innumeracy</span>[^1].

People were not numerate, it had said, and that was *bad*.

As a society, we have several words that describe abilities people
should have. The most common of these are “literacy” and “numeracy.”
Society says that we should all be able to read and do basic work with
numbers. But is that enough? I’m reminded of a Heinlein quote:

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
> butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, **write a sonnet**,
> balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
> orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, **solve equations**,
> analyze a new problem, pitch manure, **program a computer**, cook a
> tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for
> insects.

Heinlein gives us a superset of modern societal expectations, wherein he
includes the ability to code. That clicked when I thought of <span
class="underline">Innumeracy</span>. It's easy to complete the pattern:
literacy, numeracy, *coderacy*. 

-   **Literacy** (n): The ability to read and write.
-   **Numeracy** (n): The ability to understand and work with numbers.
-   **Coderacy** (n): The ability to program computers.

Modern educators may disagree, but I think [more
people](/2012/01/programming-education-rationality/) should be able to 
program computers. These
skills will only become more common and relevant, as years pass[^3].

With that, I suspect you can guess the domain name, if not the purpose,
of my new project. More to come soon.
