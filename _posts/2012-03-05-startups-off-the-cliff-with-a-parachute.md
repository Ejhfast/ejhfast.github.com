title: Don't Jump off the Cliff with a Parachute

When we launched [Proxino](http://proxino.com), I was enrolled in
Stanford’s CS PhD program. Now I’m not. Through my transition, I’ve
learned a bit about human incentives, and the pitfalls of
over-optimization.

A proper set of incentives is essential to startup success. You’ll often
see these described with
[cliff-jumping](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=startups+jump+off+cliff+fly#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=startups+jump+off+cliff+&pbx=1&oq=startups+jump+off+cliff+&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=26901l27247l0l27456l3l3l0l0l0l0l113l283l1.2l3l0&gs_l=serp.3...26901l27247l0l27456l3l3l0l0l0l0l113l283l1j2l3l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=24191f1b078a19c4&biw=1290&bih=1058)
imagery, and that’s a good metaphor. Jump off the cliff, and you had
better learn to fly. Otherwise, bad things happen. I know this from
experience.

You see, I jumped off the cliff with a parachute.

You’d think a parachute would offer me some advantage, and in many ways,
it did. The probability that I’d destroy myself on the rocks shrunk to
an infinitesimal value. But when you have a parachute, learning to fly
becomes much harder. It’s no longer a *do or die* sort of situation.

To further extend the metaphor, I thought I *wanted to fly* so much that
this wouldn’t make any difference. Maybe that’s true[^1]. But
although running a startup is a [lonely
business](http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the-summer-founders-program-fixes-the-common/563217.html),
I wasn’t not the only actor involved. And not just because I had a
co-founder.

I failed to appreciate that that even if *I* could override the
cognitive biases induced by altered incentives, others might not be able
(or willing) to do the same. When running a business, the perceptions of
others matter. So here’s a bit of advice from someone who’s given it a
lot of thought:

Don’t over-think things, just jump off the cliff.

[^1]: I like to think so, but I’m admittedly biased.
