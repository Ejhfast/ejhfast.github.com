title: More on Coderacy and Mental Models

Francis Fukuyama speaks of mental models.

His latest book, <span class="underline">The Origins of Political
Order</span>[^1], delves into prehuman history and attempts to
explain the increasing growth and complexity of human social structure
and organization. In its earliest chapters, I was excited to see the
book engage in a brief discussion of human cognitive architecture —
including cognitive biases — which Fukuyama leverages against his
understanding of human social practice. But Fukuyama also suggests
something that, while obvious, I hadn’t fully considered.

He says that *language is the machinery by which mental models are
constructed*. As human language evolved, our species developed more
complex and predictive models, which we then applied successfully to our
environment. It’s a rather obvious point, but also a powerful one when
you acknowledge it explicitly.

Once you accept that humans use language to model their environment, it
becomes very hard to disagree with the point I make in [Programming,
Education, and
Rationality](/2012/01/programming-education-rationality/). Coderacy[^2] encourages rational thought because a programming language, like
mathematical formalism, is just a *different kind of language*. Codearcy
augments the mental language we use to build models of the world, and
does so quite powerfully.

Human languages are ambiguous. This is a great strength when it comes to
[artistic expression](/2012/03/programmers-can-be-artists/), but not one
without tradeoffs. Ambiguous models are bad models[^3] — in fact,
they aren’t really models at all, in the scientific sense. So the
rationalist is well-served by a mental framework which allows them to
construct *unambiguous* and *consistent* mental models. Coderacy helps
provide this framework.

One you’re coderate, you begin to think in terms of code, algorithms and
processes. Code doesn’t allow for ambiguity, or sanction those
wonderful cracks which render the English language open to
interpretation and modern literary criticism. Coderacy enables the sort
of unambiguous language that a truly predictive model requires. So
here’s the three step plan:

Become coderate, build a better mental model, and rule the world[^4].

[^1]: A wonderful book so far, here’s an [amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Origins-Political-Order-Prehuman-Revolution/dp/0374533229/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1). I’m actually listening to it on audible. The narrator is excellent, the same guy who does Gene Wolfe’s <span class="underline">The Book of the New Sun</span>.

[^2]: The ability to program computers. See [this post](/2012/02/the-rise-of-coderacy/).

[^3]: True at least for the colloquial meaning of “ambiguity”. Someone may well have constructed a formalism which they choose to call an “ambiguous model.” This isn’t what I mean.

[^4]: The [less wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) community has discussed this, I think, with varying degrees of seriousness.
