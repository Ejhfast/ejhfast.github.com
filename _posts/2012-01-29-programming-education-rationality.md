Do you hold a consistent mental model of the world? 
For many of us the answer is “no.”
That’s troubling. It’s hard to be correct, if your world-view doesn’t
even type check[^1]. People are entitled to opinions. But hold them
in a state of contradiction, and they’re wrong.

Though it’s easy enough to apply consistency checks, inconsistent
world-views abound. I suspect it’s because people never *learn* to be
consistent. Education under-represents logic and reason in the
classroom. High school math class is the closest many people come to an
education in rationality, and math is “just too abstract.”

People think they aren’t good at math, or that it’s not practical. This
may be unavoidable. But math, as taught at the level of K-12 education,
is not the only way to develop notions of logic and reason. For
something else *is* practical: computer programming[^2].

Held at the right level of abstraction, programming is no more difficult
than basic mathematics. It’s certainly valued in the workplace. Yet few
public schools teach it, and almost no elementary schools do[^3].
Programming teaches the value of logic and consistency, but still
appeals to a narrow view of self-interest[^4]. It even engenders
creativity (more so than mathematics, at beginning levels). All this
would seem perfect for the modern student.

Perhaps educators haven’t caught up with modern trends, or
infrastructural costs are too high. I know little, directly, of the
education space, and so I won’t comment. But it does seem we miss an
opportunity, when we abandon computing to the highest levels of
education. Get them while they’re young — the world would benefit from
more rational minds, and more consistent mental models.
