You should ask the question more often. What the question is doesn’t
particularly matter, nor does the reason you ask it. You don’t even have
to say anything, not vocally.

But you should ask anyway.

[Implicit assumptions](/2012/04/importance-of-perception/) can be
dangerous. I often find myself wondering, as I reconstruct a
conversation I’ve just enjoyed, why I took *that* at face value (and
*that* can be just about anything). I’m sure most people have had a
similar experience. Yet *that* doesn’t have be a human utterance. It
might be a sale at your local supermarket, or an unfamiliar face that
meets your eyes across a crowded intersection.

The important thing is a thing of omission. You didn’t question *that*,
whatever it was. You just imbibed it, and shoved it — perhaps kicking
and screaming — into your existing worldview. You may have made a
mistake, or you may have been entirely correct, but you never thought
about it.

Of course you can’t truly think about everything you do. This would be
an enormous waste of time. But it’s safe to say that most of us are in
no danger of introspective paralysis, at least not with respect to our
perceptions. So ask the question more often. It doesn’t matter what you
ask.

To be useful, the question needs only to exist.
