title: The Signal is not the Goal

I’ve
[warned](http://ethanfast.com/2011/05/the-artful-mastering-of-goals/)
against too strong an investment in goals, if you risk altering your
motivations. Self-modification is a dangerous thing, and behavior often
leads to belief[^1]. As Pascal might say (and I paraphrase): “Have
trouble believing in God? Just go to church.”

Consider your environment carefully, for if you are like most humans,
you might start to conform. It’s a subtle process.

But this isn’t the end of the story. Goals are tricky, and you should
take care to choose them properly. Sometimes, people mistake signal for
substance. I need to remind myself on occasion: *the signal is not the
goal*. Signaling that you’re on a path to Greatness doesn’t mean you’re
actually walking it.

When you set a signal as your goal, you misinterpret causality. I have
seen people who might say, “Great persons X, Y, and Z got PhD’s from Harvard,
and so I should do that too.” They confuse cause with effect.

Great people tend to have reasons for doing
what they do. They don’t simply follow some greedy function of ambition,
snatching up opportunities that look like something in which a
successful person might engage. To the extent that a Great person
signals Greatness with a fancy degree or credential, this signal is
often a byproduct of a specific goal she set out to achieve. It is not
the root cause of the success, but a side-effect.

Suppose that persons X, Y, and Z are Great Philosophers. In undergrad
they wrote impressive things. They had no social life
and thought all day about philosophy. Perhaps, these qualities got them
into good PhD programs.

And perhaps (cue the shudder), what made them Great was not their credential,
but their innate talent and devotion to philosophy[^2].

Our undergrad ought not to worry about getting into the PhD programs,
but rather about studying philosophy. While they also need to be
*noticed* (signaling never goes away), that is not the main thing. For
if they set the signal as the goal and
spend all of their time schmoozing with professors instead of studying
philosophy, this won't help much in the long run. Even if they gain
entry into the program, they won’t be able to take advantage of the
opportunity[^3].

So I try to be careful. Signaling is important, but it is not the
endgame. It does not lead to Greatness.

[^1]: I’m sure that a few thousand books have been written on the power of habit, but I haven’t read any of them.

[^2]: Of course this is not completely true. There are better peers, mentors, and resources at good universities.

[^3]: For similar reasons, most undergrads shouldn’t drop out of Harvard or Stanford, despite the signal this might send (look at those rich founder dropouts)!
